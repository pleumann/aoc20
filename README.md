# Advent of Code 2020
This repo contains solutions for Advent of Code 2020 in Java, all wrapped in a NetBeans project.

After building, the typical way to run a certain puzzle is (from the project directory):

```
java -cp dist/AdventOfCode20.jar day01.Puzzle1 src/day01/input.txt
```

Replace day and (01-25) puzzle number (1 or 2) as needed. Some solutions also contain one or more
```example.txt``` files that could be fed into the main class as a replacement for ```input.txt```.

Note that ```input.txt``` contains the input data I received. Yours may (and probably will) be different.
